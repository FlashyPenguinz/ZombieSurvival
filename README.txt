This was an old game I worked on before and never really touched on again, to be honest, this is one of my games that has gone the farthest with client server communication, Zombie AI Pathfinding, and many other things that can be found if you just look inside. Hopefully I will touch on this and recreate it in its completion one day as I was a fun thing to work on.
